# Customer Segmentation using K-Means
# 🧠 Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs customer segmentation using machine learning to group customers based on behavior and spending patterns. This enables businesses to personalize marketing, improve customer experience, and increase revenue.

## 🎯 Objective
- Analyze purchasing behavior of customers
- Apply clustering to identify customer segments
- Visualize patterns between spending score and income
